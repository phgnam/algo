# Q: Interest In Company


*Why do you want to work at <company-name>?*


Hey everybody, welcome to AlgoExpert.
In this video we're gonna answer the following behavioral interview question.
Why do you wanna work at, insert company name?
So, quick pause before I answer this question, I'm gonna answer this question as if I were currently working at Google, and applying to Facebook.
So the question would be, why do I wanna work at Facebook?
Of course, you would answer this question, targeting the company that you're interviewing at. 
So, I wanna work at Facebook for three main reasons.
The first one is from a purely technical point of view.
I know that Facebook works with a lot of technologies that really excite me, technologies that I've worked a lot on in personal projects, but that I've never had the opportunity to work on in a production grade engineering environment.
So for example, a lot of the front end technologies that Facebook uses, like React, Redux, Flow, I have a lot of TypeScript experience, but I've heard really good things about Flow.
I'm also particularly interested in GraphQL, so I'd love to see how Facebook's various teams use GraphQL.
So basically, all of, or a lot of, Facebook's technology stack really excites me and interests me.
Now, putting aside the technical stuff for a bit, I'm also really interested or excited about Facebook's culture of moving fast.
I've heard about the, I don't know if it's an unofficial or official motto, move fast and break things, I don't know if that's kind of an old motto or a recent one, or still applicable today, but the point is, I have heard that Facebook has a very unique culture of moving fast.
And that's something that really excites me.
Having worked at Google for two years now, even though I've had incredible opportunities,
I've worked with incredible people, in a very, you know, engineering excellence driven company, one thing that has been frustrating at times has been the slowness of some of the engineering projects I've worked on.
And from a few peers I've known who worked at Google and now have gone to Facebook, apparently this difference in culture and the velocity with which you can ship out code and ship out projects, launch projects and features, is pretty dramatic, the difference between the two companies, and so, I'm really excited about that at Facebook.
Finally, the third thing that is particularly attracting me to Facebook, is Facebook's bootcamp experience.
So, most of the other companies I've looked at, when you apply to them, you have to apply to a specific team, or for example at Google, you don't apply to a specific team, in most cases, but once you pass the interviews, you go through their team matching process and you have to commit to a team before your first day on the job.
At Facebook, I've read a lot about the bootcamp experience and my recruiter told me about it.
I'm really excited about being able to try out, actually work on multiple different teams, before having to commit to one.
That's something that is incredible unique, I haven't heard about another company doing that.
It's something that really is appealing to me.
And on that note, you know, at the end of the interview, if we have time I'd love to ask you what your experience was with bootcamp, what you liked about it and how it worked.
