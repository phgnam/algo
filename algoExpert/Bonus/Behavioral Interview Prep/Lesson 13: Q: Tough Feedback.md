# Q: Tough Feedback


*How do you think about receiving and giving feedback? Describe a time when you received tough feedback and/or a time when you gave tough feedback. How did you react to it? How did you give it?*


Hey, everybody.
Welcome to Algo Expert.
In this video we're gonna answer the following behavioral interview question: How do you think about receiving and giving feedback?  Describe a time when you received tough feedback and/or a time when you gave tough feedback.
How did you react to it? How did you give it? So, I'm a firm believer in giving constructive feedback by way of radical transparency.
Now, I realize that the term, or the expression, "radical transparency" is a bit of a buzzword, but I do think that it's a very useful one and a very applicable one here in the context of giving feedback.
You want to be very prompt and direct in giving your feedback, or in receiving feedback.
There is no better way to improve as a human being, and, of course, as a software engineer, if we're talking about this in the context of software engineering, than by receiving quality constructive feedback that is direct, that doesn't put thing vaguely or fluff things up, and that is also prompt, meaning it doesn't come two months, three months after the fact, it comes one week or one day after something has occurred that deserves feedback.
Now, one additional thing that I wanna add here is that I think it's very important, when giving feedback, and receiving feedback, to give or ask for actionable steps to improve.
In other words, it doesn't really help a person who is receiving feedback if you just tell them that they're doing something wrong or doing something poorly without telling them how they can improve, what they can do, what steps they can take to improve.
So that's very important.
But, really, I think that this concept of radical transparency is super-useful and it's very different from being overly-harsh and just mean to people, which is obviously not good and not useful, and very different from being overly-nice and hiding things from people just to protect them, so to speak.
That doesn't help them.
And so, as far as examples of when I've received and given feedback, one particular example that comes to mind for when I received feedback was near the start of my career as a software engineer at Google.
I think I had been at Google for about two or three months, and one of my peers, following a poll request that I had sent out with code, basically came up to me and told me, "Hey, Clement, this might sound harsh, but I just wanna tell you I think you're writing certain front-end components the wrong way.
Well, not necessarily the wrong way, but in a sub-optimal way." And, of course, as with all kinds of constructive feedback, which is, effectively, negative feedback, but meant to improve you, I reacted a little bit.
You know, had a bit of a tense reaction.
You always feel, you're kinda like, "Uh, am I being attacked?" or whatever.
But you quickly realize, like, this is how you improve.
And so I had a good conversation with him, and we talked about how I could actually, why were these front-end components that I was writing sup-optimal? What was bad, or what could be improved about them? And I learnt a lot from that.
We talked about stateless components versus stateful components, all that stuff, all that good front-engineering stuff, and I really improved following that conversation.
I noticed it, you know, when I would write future poll requests and future components, that the things that this person had told me were true, and I was now applying them.
And it was just a great experience.
Now, for the time that I gave feedback to someone, this was one of the first interns that I hosted while at Google.
And I remember this was a really bright person, really excited, really talented, very good software engineer.
One thing that he would do that wasn't particularly good, that could've been improved, was that, especially in our one-on-one meetings, and even in group meetings, he would often start talking, start asking questions or start giving ideas, but it kinda felt like he hadn't prepared his thoughts, and he would start rambling on for pretty noticeable periods of time.
And so I told him after I saw him do that, I think, like, three times, so pretty promptly, I told him in one of our one-on-one meetings, "Hey, this is something where I think you could improve on." As far as actionable steps, I told him, "Just try to prepare yourself and gather your thoughts a little bit more before you take the microphone, so to speak." And, again, as with any time that you give feedback or receive feedback, when it's constructive and it effectively feels like it's negative, you kind of tense up.
I could see it in his face.
But afterwards he totally accepted it, acknowledged it and, at our next one-on-one, he told me that he really appreciated the feedback, he really took it to heart.
And what do you know, by the end of the internship he had completely improved in this regard.
And not only had he continued to be a great public speaker, but he was really honing his skills of not rambling on, being prepared before speaking.
So that was another great example of where direct, radically transparent, prompt feedback is very useful.
