# Introduction


*You've conquered distributed systems. You've mastered data structures. And most importantly, you can reverse a linked list in your sleep. So what's the final obstacle standing between you and your dream job?*


*You guessed itâ€”it's those pesky behavioral interviews!*


Hey everybody, welcome to AlgoExpert.
This is the introductory video of the behavioral interviews content, right here on AlgoExpert.
The goal of this video is to give you a clear idea of where behavioral interviews fit into the entire software engineering interview process.
At this point, if you're watching this video, you likely have a pretty good idea, you're likely relatively familiar with the fact that at big tech companies and at tech startups, technical interviews come in two different flavors.
Coding interviews, and systems design interviews.
And of course, we prepare you for these two types of interviews a lot, right here on AlgoExpert and SystemsExpert.
But so, if you take coding interviews, as their name suggests, they assess you on your coding skills, and of course your data structures and algorithms knowledge, and if you take systems design interviews, as their name suggests, they assess you on your systems design skills.
Your ability to design large scale distributed systems.
Both of these interviews or interview genres are technical, and they do spill a little bit into non-technical stuff, for example, they assess your problem-solving ability, 'cause you're given a problem and you have to solve it.
They assess your communication skills, 'cause you have to talk to your interviewers, you have to walk them through your train of thought, and they do even assess your ability to for instance, deal with an ambiguous environment, or an ambiguous problem.
'Cause presumably you're given a problem that you've never seen before, you have to ask clarifying questions, and so on and so forth.
So the point that I'm trying to get at here is that these interviews, coding interviews and systems design interviews, are technical.
They do assess you on a few non-technical things, but at the end of the day, all that being said, they do remain technical interviews.
And if you've ever worked professionally as a software engineer, either as a full time engineer or as an intern, or maybe you've never worked professionally as an engineer.
Maybe you're straight out of college or out of a coding bootcamp, but you've worked as part of a team on a software engineering project, then you know that there's a lot more to being a software engineer, than just coding and designing systems.
There's a lot more to being a software engineer than just algorithms and data structures, and proxies and load balancers.
There's a lot more to it.
And, that thing that constitutes the a lot more, is often very nuanced.
It's very ... it falls into the soft skill category, if you will.
All right, we're talking about dealing with production outages, or dealing with conflict at work.
Having to manage a large project and distribute work amongst engineers.
All of this stuff is very nuanced, it's very important in software engineering, and it's not assessed in coding interviews and in systems design interviews.
And as you might have guessed it, this is exactly where behavioral interviews come into play.
Behavioral interviews are a third type of interview, they're non-technical, and they assess you on these more nuanced but very important parts of software engineering.
So at this point, I hope that you have a clearer idea of what behavioral interviews are, or rather, where they fit into the entire software engineering interview process, and with that, I'll see you in the next video.
