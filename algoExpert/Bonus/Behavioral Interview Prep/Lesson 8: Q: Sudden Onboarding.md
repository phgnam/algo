# Q: Sudden Onboarding


*Imagine you and your team are in the middle of a major project at work, with many moving parts, complicated context, a lot of work, etc.. A new software engineer joins your team, and you're tasked with onboarding them; what do you do?*


Hey, everybody.
Welcome to AlgoExpert.
In this video, we're gonna answer the following behavioral interview question.
Imagine you and your team  are in the middle of a major project at work with many moving parts, complicated context, a lot of work, et cetera.
A new software engineer joins your team and you're tasked with onboarding them.
What do you do?
So, first of all, I really wanna emphasize how important I think properly onboarding a new engineer is.
Because if you improperly onboard a new engineer, not only are you gonna give them a very bad first impression of your team and of your company, which in turn will give them a bad first experience and just make them unhappy, which isn't good, but also you will be causing a lot of other negative effects to trickle down later on, on them as a person, because they won't be set up to perform properly and they might just perform poorly, they might have a bad career trajectory because of your improper onboarding experience that you gave them.
But you'll also be having negative impact on your team because suddenly you'll have to take more work, you'll have to do more work, you'll have to do the work that they were supposed to do, you'll have to handhold them more and it'll just be bad for your team, and of course in turn, this will negatively affect your company.
Because if your team isn't performing well, or if your team is too stressed, then your company is gonna be affected.
So all that to say, that onboarding a new engineer is very important, should be taken very seriously, even if you're we're in the middle of a very large project with a lot of work.
You have to prioritize onboarding the new engineer.
Now, hopefully you've done some pre-planning, hopefully, you've been preparing for this new engineer.
You knew ahead of time that they were gonna be coming.
But either way, three things that you can do to give them a great onboarding experience, I think these are probably the three most important things.
Number 1, is having proper documentation in place.
And I suppose this one is one that takes pre-planning.
You have to have done that beforehand.
but having proper documentation in place for the onboarding aspects of their job, like getting their new dev environment set up, the dev environment that you're working on as part of your team, knowing where they need to go to access important information, or to do certain things.
All of this stuff can be very easily captured in documentation.
It can save you a ton of time, and it's just very important.
There's nothing more frustrating than being a new engineer, trying to get your dev environment set up and just getting a bunch of errors that nobody knows about that nobody's documented anywhere.
It just is a really bad experience.
So that's number 1, documentation.
Number 2, is it's very important for you or for me in this case, if I'm the one onboarding this new engineer, to make myself available for any questions that they might have and anything that they might need to unblock them.
Especially when they are joining a team, like you're in the first few days, first couple of weeks, they're naturally gonna have a lot of questions they're naturally gonna have a lot things that they're blocked on.
And you will be able to solve that, you will be able to help them there.
And you don't want them wasting half a day or even a full day doing something or trying to figure out something that you could have basically unblocked them on in 10 seconds.
So very important, make yourself available or make myself available for any questions that they have.
And I think here, being overly available is much better than being underwhelmingly available, if that makes sense.
Finally, the third thing I think that you have to do to give them a great onboarding experience is you have to very carefully pick the projects or the bug that they'll work on.
And so, the strategy that I've found historically has worked best for me, for interns that I've managed, multiple interns and for full-time employees just as well, of any level, is to first, once they've set up everything, to start them out with one or two very, very simple bugs.
Here we're talking, if we're working on the front end to set text change or a button color change.
Something to just get them acclimated to the code base, get them used to pushing up code, getting code reviews, all of that.
That's just a very nice way to get their fingers wet without overwhelming them.
And that should take a day, 2 days at most.
Then, give them what I like to call a starter project.
This is a project that's gonna take maybe a week at most 2 weeks.
It should be very small and self-contained, not affecting or not depending on anybody else, but it should ideally, and again, this is where pre-planning comes into play, ideally, it's something that we'll have a decent amount of impact, and for instance, again, coming from a front end engineering background, something that will be visible, that you'll be able to launch that maybe a customer had requested, but that wasn't super-important.
That way, it'll also give them a nice, quick win.
They'll have a quick win, they'll launch something, they'll feel proud, and ideally they'll have touched a few parts of the code base and just feel even more prepared to actually do, complex software engineering work on your team.
And then finally, the third step of this process, is to give them their first big project.
And this should be something that, again ideally, is self-contained.
You don't want that this to be on the critical path of your big project.
Especially if you're working on a huge project, super-stressful, you don't want them to be blocking everybody else, right?
And that's gonna be terrible for your team because if you're gonna be dependent on someone who's completely new, that's gonna be a lot of stress for them, they're not gonna like that, and you just don't want that.
So, something that's out of the critical path that is something that they can handle alone that is appropriate for their level, you have to think, are they a new grad or are they a staff software engineer with tons of experience?
And kind of measure the project appropriately for that.
And that's it.
And of course, apart from that, just being there, being a good teammate, going to lunch with them and all sorts of social things that you would expect from a team,
That's how I would handle onboarding a new engineer suddenly.
