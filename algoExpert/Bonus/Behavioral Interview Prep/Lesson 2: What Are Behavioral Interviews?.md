# What Are Behavioral Interviews?


*While these non-technical interviews may seem nebulous and outlandish in concept, their purpose is clear: for you to highlight your strengths and to invoke your past experiences through the classic art of storytelling.*


Hey everybody, welcome to AlgoExpert.
In this video, we're gonna explain what behavioral interviews really are.
The interesting thing about behavioral interviews is that on the one hand, they're very easy to define, but on the other hand, they're very difficult to define.
Difficult because depending on the company that you're interviewing at, or the type of candidate that you are, for example, how much work experience you have, what company you're coming from, or what school or what coding boot camp you're coming from.
Depending on that, they might be packaged a little bit differently.
For example, if you're interviewing at Google for a software engineering position, as of mid 2018 I think, all of their behavioral interviews are called "Googleyness" and Leadership Interviews, and they assess you on your "Googleyness" and Leadership.
"Googleyness" is a Google specific term that means a lot of things.
And as you'll see in a second, it's not that much different from what other companies.
My understanding is that behavioral interviews at Facebook are just called non-technical interviews.
So the point is, depending on the company you're interviewing at these behavioral interviews might be labeled differently or might claim to focus on different things.
Now, the other thing that makes them difficult to define is that like I hinted at before, they might actually be delivered differently.
So for example, you might get a full 45 minute interview that is a behavioral interview, or you might even get two full 45 minute interviews that are behavioral interviews.
Typically that that would only be if you're applying for a managerial position or a leadership position, but you know, for a normal software engineer, I would say it's just one interview, but you might get two or on the flip side, you might actually get a behavioral interview that's only half of another technical interview.
As an example, when I interviewed at Facebook for a software engineering position, my final interview of the day, my fourth interview, was about two thirds behavioral.
The first 30 minutes were behavioral and then the last 15 minutes were coding.
It was just a coding interview for the last 15 minutes.
So again, point is kind of difficult to give a clear cut definition of what a behavioral interview is because they might look a little bit different depending on the company and who you are.
Now, on the other hand, I did mention that behavioral interviews are actually easy to define.
And the reason they're easy is because at the end of the day, no matter what they're called, what the companies tell you they're called, whatever, no matter any of that, they all assess you on basically the same things.
They all assess you on those nuanced software engineering skills that I mentioned in the introductory video that we've got right here on the behavioral interviews, content on AlgoExpert.
And they all look for the same qualities in you the candidate, and here I could list off dozens of qualities that they look for in candidates.
They're really any quality that you would expect someone would want in a software engineer or in an employee.
Things like humility, respect, being a good team player, being able to work under pressure, being able to handle conflict, to learn from your mistakes, to show initiative, to show leadership, all of these types of qualities, these behavioral interviews are looking for and are assessing.
Now, hopefully at this point, you understand, you know, what these behavioral interviews are looking for, but you might be wondering, okay, what are they though?
What is a behavioral interview?
What might I expect from a behavioral interview?
And here it's pretty simple.
Basically a behavioral interview is gonna be a conversation, a long conversation between you and the interviewer, except that the conversation will be almost entirely one sided.
They will be asking you a few questions and you have to talk for most of the time.
And these questions will almost exclusively be about your background and your experiences with a few caveats like, you know, why are you interested in our company?
Or you know, tell me about your strengths and weaknesses.
Although even that one is basically about your background, but so these questions will be asked in such a way, or rather with the intention that you paint a picture or that you describe your background and experiences, and through this description, paint a picture of yourself that is ideally positive that ideally shows that you have those qualities that we're looking for.
That ideally shows that you have those nuanced software engineering skills and so on and so forth.
So the types of questions that you might be asked, we have dozens of them here on the behavioral interviews content on AlgoExpert.
If you scroll down on the page, you'll see a bunch of them and we give you also sample answers, but there are things like tell me about a challenging project that you worked on and what lessons did you learn from it?
Or tell me about a time where you were working on a project and there was a low performer on the project.
How did you handle that situation?
Or tell me about a time where you had to give or receive tough feedback, these types of questions.
And again, there are many of them that you can be asked.
We cover a lot of examples on this page, on the behavioral interviews content on AlgoExpert, and you have to be able to draw from your experiences to answer them.
Now, one important thing to note here is that depending on the interview, and this might depend on the interviewer, like the person asking you the questions, it might depend on the company, but depending on you know, whatever situation you find yourself in, you might be asked questions that are a little bit more detailed, or you might be asked questions that are less detailed.
So if you look at the ones that we have here on AlgoExpert, you'll notice that they air on the detailed side.
Most of our questions are almost divided into three questions.
For example, it'll be something like, tell me about a time where you did something, then how did you handle that situation?
And then what lessons did you learn from it?
Those are three different questions.
And that's why the sample answers that I give here on AlgoExpert, are actually relatively long.
Some of them are seven, eight, even nine minutes.
Those are on the longer end of what I would advise you to take as far as time goes in a normal behavioral interview answer.
But it's possible that in your interviews, you might be asked the same questions just divided into three parts in a more conversational way.
So you might be asked, describe briefly a challenging project that you worked on, period.
And you would answer for about two or three minutes.
Then how did you handle this project?
Or how did you distribute the work amongst your peers for this project?
And you answer with three or four minutes, then what are some lessons that you drew from this project?
So the point that I'm trying to make here is that there is no clear cut way in which a behavioral interview question might be asked and you have to be ready or prepared to you know, deal with different ways that it might be asked.
Now, the last thing that's important to note here about behavioral interviews is that, and this is kind of a nice thing.
There is no right or wrong answer to a behavioral interview question.
You can certainly give a poor answer and we'll get into what that means in the next video, the video where we share some general tips on how to do well in these behavioral interviews, but you can't really give a wrong answer.
It's not like a coding interview where you can literally give a wrong answer.
You can give an answer that doesn't pass the test cases, an incorrect algorithm or something with a bug.
Here, if I ask you, tell me about a challenging project that you worked on.
There is no better answer for a challenging project.
It doesn't matter if the challenging project that you choose to talk about is something incredibly complex, like, you know, the Google search algorithms, I'm just making stuff up.
Or if it's something very simple, like, oh, a pet project that you worked on in college, if you're a new grad, that you worked on, you know, on the side, like a little application, a web app, doesn't really matter.
What matters is, can you paint a story?
Can you, you know, describe your experience in such a way that highlights some of the qualities that we hinted at earlier and some of those software engineering skills that we talked about in the introductory video here on AlgoExpert, that's what matters.
There is no right or wrong answer.
And that's Really nice about behavioral interviews.
Because that means that you shouldn't be too stressed about your background, instead you should just focus on how can I highlight positive things from my background and the one caveat here is that unfortunately some people will take this to mean that they don't need to prepare at all for behavioral interviews and that can actually backfire on them because even though there are no right or wrong answers, you do need to be able to highlight these good things that we just mentioned.
You need to be able to talk about your past experiences in such a way that will be meaningful.
And the thing that these companies do is that they really go in detail to really understand all the nuances of your past experience.
So they ask you something like, tell me about a challenging project, they don't just want you to tell them I worked on a web app.
They're gonna really dig deep to understand what exactly is it that you did? What exactly were your teammates doing?
What exactly was the conflict and so on and so forth.
So from that point of view, you do still need to be prepared to go into detail and to talk in depth about these things.
And also, depending on your comfort with impromptu speaking, you might want to be prepared on all these topics.
So at this point, hopefully you have a clear idea of what a behavioral interview is and what it looks like, the types of questions that you might be asked.
And again, if you scroll down on this page, you'll see a bunch of them, a bunch of examples.
And of course, you'll see a bunch of sample answers.
And now in the next video, we're going to cover some tips on how to not give poor answers, how to give good answers.
Although I did say that there is no good answer.
I meant more that there's no right answer.
So we'll go over some tips on how to give a good answer.
What things to avoid, what things to do and so on and so forth.
On that note, I'll see you in the next video.
