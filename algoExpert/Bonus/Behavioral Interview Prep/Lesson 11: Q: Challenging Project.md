# Q: Challenging Project


*Describe a challenging project that you worked on. Why was it challenging? What was your role in the project? How did you deal with the various difficulties of the project?*


Hey everybody, welcome to AlgoExpert.
In this video, we're gonna answer the following behavioral interview question.
Describe a challenging project that you worked on, why was it challenging?
What was your role in the project?
How did you deal with the various difficulties of the project? So throughout my software engineering career, I've certainly worked on a lot of challenging projects.
One that comes to mind here, is a particularly challenging project.
This was the very last project that I ever work on when I was a software engineer at Google.
The reason this project was particularly challenging is many fold, in other words, there are a lot of reasons for it was challenging.
First of all, it was a large project.
The surface area of the project was two times, if not three times the surface area of any other project that I had worked on.
I worked on a front-end team and so, you know, a good way to quantify that was, how many new pages does a project involve and this project involved basically twice the amount of existing pages we had on our UI.
So it was a very large project.
It was also a very new and I say new in scare quotes because specifically we were gonna be hitting a new API and that's kind of a big deal on Google Cloud platform, which was the organization that I was working on.
When there's a new API, it doesn't happen all the time and we were gonna have a new API for our particular product.
On top of that, we had very little time to complete this project, so not only was it large but we had very little time.
To put things into perspective, most previous projects that I had worked on, we had at least two quarters, maybe two and a half quarters to work on them, here this project was announced to us at the very end of Q4 in 2018, so like early December and we had to launch the product or the feature at the end of Q1 or early Q2 of 2019.
So we basically only had like a quarter, little over a quarter to complete this project.
And then the final thing that was really hard about this project was the fact that we were only three, three and a half, 'cause had an intern coming in, front-end software engineers on my team in the New York office, which is where I was and with only three and a half engineers, we would never have been able to do this project or three engineers if you don't count the intern, who hadn't even joined the team when we first heard about this project.
So we were gonna need other front-end engineers and it so happens that there was a team in South Korea, the South Korea office that Google has, that was part of the organization that I was in and they were gonna join us, but that meant that we had to onboard a brand new team of engineers, whom we had never met before, who had never worked on Google Cloud platform before and who were based in South Korea, which was 14 hours ahead of the United States New York office.
So a lot of complications, a very, very challenging project.
Now my role on the project was to lead to the project.
I was basically the project leader, the tech lead of the project and the way that I decided to approach it was, I started out by scoping out the entire project.
You know, we had heard whispers of the project at the end of Q4 2018 like I said, and so I started documenting everything that I heard, any meeting that I went to where we were learning more about the project from product managers and a few other people, I was writing down and I started to scope out the work that we were gonna have to do.
And then when in early Q1 2019, we actually went to South Korea for basically an entire week to meet this new team of engineers and to do a big, like design sprint to really scope out the entire feature as a team.
I took a bunch of notes.
We had this huge running doc with basically everything that we needed to know about this feature and I made it a point throughout the week to basically ask every single question that I predicted we would have in the future, you know, I kind of pulled from my experience on previous projects, remembered what are things that you tend to run in to as an engineer when you're developing a feature.
Let's clarify all of those things right now, right off the bat, so that we have all this visibility.
And that turned out to actually be pretty successful, that trip.
And so then when it came time to actually just distribute the work and get to work, what I did was, I tried to be as granular as possible, without going too granular.
So I would scope out like, you know, this page, that page, you know, very like logically separated sub-features of the entire feature.
And anything that required heavy context in our code base, I assigned to the engineers in New York, who had been working on our code base for a long time and anything that didn't require that much context, of course everything does require a little bit of context, but the things that required the least amount of context, I assigned to the engineers who were working out of the South Korea office and so they were newer to the code base.
Then I also leveraged the fact that I was hosting an intern, I mentioned that before.
I'm a firm believer that you never wanna give an intern, like critical work that is gonna be blocking a launch, however here the nice was thing was that, this project was huge and we had kind of, you know, picked the sub-features that were critical to the launch of this project and the ones that were less critical that were more like nice to haves and I had my intern work on those nice to haves.
That way we were kind of killing two birds with one stone.
You know, providing my intern with a great experience and a good project but also a project that happened to be relevant to this, you know, greater challenging project.
And then otherwise, apart from that, I acted as the glue between everybody else.
So I did all of the kind of administrative work and the work of communicating requirements and progress and everything across all the teams.
I made the sacrifice of being the person communicating with the South Korea team, you know, in a weekly meeting, so I would stay pretty late at the office in the New York city office which was fine with the rest of my team.
We had kind of established that as a thing, that I would come in maybe a bit later so that I could have a meeting and FaceTime, you know, over the wire with the team in South Korea and it turned out that the project ended up doing really well and succeeding and I suppose on that note, I should add that, you know, not only did we scope out the project in a smart way and we pushed back on anything that really seemed like it was gonna be impossible to create or to build out in time, but we also laid out some good, clear success metrics.
We laid out what are the things that we really need to accomplish in order to deem this project a success, what are the things that will fall into the nice to have category, the type of work that I assigned to my intern and it just worked really nicely and it ended up being a very successful project and probably, you know, the project that I'm most proud of that I worked on at Google.
