# BST Contruction

https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/bst-construction

Write a `BST` class for a Binary Search Tree. The class should support:
- Inserting values with the `insert` method.
- Removing values with the `remove` method; this method should only remove the first instance of a given value.
- Searching for values with the contains methods.

Note that you can't remove values from a signle-node tree. In other words, calling the `remove` method on a single-node tree should simply not do anything.

Each `BST` node has an integer `value`, a `left` child node, and a `right` child node. A node is said to be a valid `BST` node if and only if it satisfies the BST property: its `value` is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its `value` is less than or euqal to the values of every node to its right; and its children nodes are either valid `BST` nodes themselves or `None` / `null`.

**Sample Usage**
```
// Assume the following BST has already been created:
          10
       /     \
     5         15
    /  \     /   \
   2    5   13     22
 /            \
1              14

// All operations below are performed sequentially.
insert(12):
          10
       /     \
     5         15
    /  \     /   \
   2    5   13     22
 /         /   \
1        12      14

insert(10):
         12
       /     \
     5         15
    /  \     /   \
   2    5   13     22
 /             \
1               14

contains(15): true
```

<summary>Hint 1</summary>
As you try to insert, find, or a remove a value into, in, or from a BST, you will have to traverse the tree's nodes. The BST property allows you to eleminate half of the remaining tree at each node that you traverse: if the target value is strictly smaller than a node's value, then it must me (or can only be) located to the left of the node, otherwise it must be (or can only be) to the right of that node.

<summary>Hint 2</summary>
Traverse the BST all the while applying the logic described in Hint #1. For insertion, add the target value to the BST once you reach a leaf (Noe/ null) node. For searching, if you reach aleaf node without having found the target value that means the value that means the value Ã­n't in the BST. For removal, consider the various the various cases that you might encounter: the node you need to remove might have two children nodes, one, or none; it might also be the root node; make sure to account for all of these cases.

<summary>Optimal Space & Time Complexity</summary>
Average (all 3 methods): O(log(n)) time | O(1) space - where n is the number of nodes in the BST Worst (all 3 methods): O(n) time | O(1) space - where n is the number of nodes in the BST</details>
