# Design Netflix

https://www.algoexpert.io/systems/workspace/design-netflix

*Many systems design questions are intentionally left very vaugue and are literally given in the form of `Design Foobar`. It's your job to ask clarifying questions to better unerstand the system that you have to build.*

*We've laid out some of these questions below; their answers should give you some guidance on the problem. Before looking at them, we encourage you to take few minutes to think about what questions you'd ask in a real interview.*

## Clarifying Questions To Ask


### Question 1

**Q: From a high-level point of view, Netflix is a fairly straightforward service: users go on the platform, they're served movies and shows, and they watch them. Are we designing this high-level system entirely, or would you like me to focus on a particular subsystem, like the Netflix home page?**

A: We're just designing the core Netflix product--so the overarching system / product that you described.



### Question 2

**Q: Should we worry about auxiliary services like authentication and payments?**

A: You can ignore those auxiliary services; focus on the primary user flow. That being said, one thing to note is that, by nature of the product, we're going to have access to a lot of user-activity data that's going to need to be processed in order to enable Netflix's recommendation system. You'll need to come up with a way to aggregate and process user-activity data on the website.



### Question 3

**Q: For this recommendation system, should I think about the kind of algorithm that'll fuel it?**

A: No, you don't need to worry about implementing any algorithm or formula for the recommendation engine. You just need to think about how user-activity data will be gathered and processed.



### Question 4

**Q: It sounds like there are 2 main points of focus in this system: the video-serving service and the recommendation engine. Regarding the video-serving service, I'm assuming that we're looking for high availability and fast latencies globally; is this correct?**

A: Yes, but just to clarify, the video-streaming service is actually the only part of the system for which we care about fast latencies.



### Question 5
**Q: So is the recommendation engine a system that consumes the user-activity data you mentioned and operates asynchronously in the background?**

A: Yes.



### Question 6

**Q: How many users do we expect to be building this for?**

A: Netflix has about 100M to 200M users, so let's go with 200M.



### Question 7

**Q: Should we worry about designing this for various clients, like desktop clients, mobile clients, etc.?**

A: Even though we're indeed designing Netflix to be used by all sorts of clients, let's focus purely on the distributed-system component--so no need to get into details about clients or to optimize for certain clients.
