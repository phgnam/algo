# Design Facebook News Feed

https://www.algoexpert.io/systems/workspace/design-facebook-news-feed

*Many systems design questions are intentionally left very vaugue and are literally given in the form of `Design Foobar`. It's your job to ask clarifying questions to better unerstand the system that you have to build.*

*We've laid out some of these questions below; their answers should give you some guidance on the problem. Before looking at them, we encourage you to take few minutes to think about what questions you'd ask in a real interview.*

## Clarifying Questions To Ask


### Question 1
**Q: Facebook News Feed consists of multiple major features, like loading a user's news feed, interacting with it (i.e., posting status updates, liking posts, etc.), and updating it in real time (i.e., adding new status updates that are being posted to the top of the feed, in real time). What part of Facebook News Feed are we designing exactly?**

A: We're designing the core functionality of the feed itself, which we'll define as follows: loading a user's news feed and updating it in real time, as well as posting status updates. But for posting status updates, we don't need to worry about the actual API or the type of information that a user can post; we just want to design what happens once an API call to post a status update has been made. Ultimately, we primarily want to design the feed generation/refreshing piece of the data pipeline (i.e, how/when does it get constructed, and how/when does it get updated with new posts).



### Question 2
**Q: To clarify, posts on Facebook can be pretty complicated, with pictures, videos, special types of status updates, etc.. Are you saying that we're not concerned with this aspect of the system? For example, should we not focus on how we'll be storing this type of information?**

A: That's correct. For the purpose of this question, we can treat posts as opaque entities that we'll certainly want to store, but without worrying about the details of the storage, the ramifications of storing and serving large files like videos, etc..



### Question 3
**Q: Are we designing the relevant-post curation system (i.e., the system that decides what posts will show up on a user's news feed)?**

A: No. We're not designing this system or any ranking algorithms; you can assume that you have access to a ranking algorithm that you can simply feed a list of relevant posts to in order to generate an actual news feed to display.



### Question 4
**Q: Are we concerned with showing ads in a user's news feed at all? Ads seem like they would behave a little bit differently than posts, since they probably rely on a different ranking algorithm.**

A: You can treat ads as a bonus part of the design; if you find a way to incorporate them in, great (and yes, you'd have some other ads-serving algorithm to determine what ads need to be shown to a user at any point in time). But don't focus on ads to start.



### Question 5
**Q: Are we serving a global audience, and how big is our audience?**

A: Yes -- we're serving a global audience, and let's say that the news feed will be loaded in the order of 100 million times a day, by 100 million different users, with 1 million new status updates posted every day.



### Question 6
**Q: How many friends does a user have on average? This is important to know, since a user's status updates could theoretically have to show up on all of the user's friends' news feeds at once.**

A: You can expect each user to have, on average, 500 friends on the social network. You can treat the number of friends per user as a bell-shaped distribution, with some users who have very few friends, and some users who have a lot more than 500 friends.



### Question 7
**Q: How quickly does a status update have to appear on a news feed once it's posted, and is it okay if this varies depending on user locations with respect to the location of the user submitting a post?**

A: When a user posts something, you probably want it to show up on other news feeds fairly quickly. This speed can indeed vary depending on user locations. For instance, we'd probably want a local friend within the same region to see the new post within a few seconds, but we'd likely be okay with a user on the other side of the world seeing the same post within a minute.



### Question 8
**Q: What kind of availability are we aiming for?**

A: Your design shouldn't be completely unavailable from a single machine failure, but this isn't a high availability requirement. However, posts shouldn't ever just disappear. Once the userâ€™s client gets confirmation that the post was created, you cannot lose it.
